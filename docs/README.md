# BookBuddy

BookBuddy is an application that helps users track and manage the list of books that they are reading. It is optimised for users that are familiar with the CLI so that the tracking and management objectives can be achieved more efficiently.

Target user and value proposition
BookBuddy targets people who are comfortable and proficient with using command-line-interfaces(CLI). These users typically prefers the efficiency and flexibility of CLI environments over Graphical user Interfaces (GUIs). They are likely to be avid readers who read multiple books simultaneously and who need an effective way to organise their reading lists.

Therefore, BookBuddy offers a streamlined and efficient solution for tracking and managing reading lists directly from the command line. It provides quick access to book management features for users who prefer keyboard-driven commands and enjoy the directness and simplicity of CLI tools. With BookBuddy, users can easily add, update, and review their reading progress without the overhead of navigating traditional graphical applications, saving time and enhancing their reading experience.
