## Project : BookBuddy
BookBuddy is a CLI-based desktop app that is targeted towards users who prefer the CLI to efficiently keep track of the books that
they have read or intend to read. BookBuddy targets casual readers who read for entertainment but not on a regular basis, avid readers
who have a huge collection of books and profession/critical readers who read scholarly journals and papers for research and work.

BookBuddy provides a one-stop solution for building a personalised reading repository,is optimised for users who are quick at typing for
efficient retrieval of book details and seeks to enable a customisable user experience to enhance the overall reading experience.

The program was created using Java. Version control was done using Sourcetree and Git.
